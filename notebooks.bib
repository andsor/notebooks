    abstract = {The compact Abelian Higgs model is simulated on a cubic lattice where it possesses vortex lines and pointlike magnetic monopoles as topological defects. The focus of this high-precision Monte Carlo study is on the vortex network, which is investigated by means of percolation observables. In the region of the phase diagram where the Higgs and confinement phases are separated by a first-order transition, it is shown that the vortices percolate right at the phase boundary, and that the first-order nature of the transition is reflected by the network. In the crossover region, where the phase boundary ceases to be first order, the vortices are shown to still percolate. In contrast to other observables, the percolation observables show finite-size scaling. The exponents characterizing the critical behavior of the vortices in this region are shown to fall in the random percolation universality class.},

    abstract = {{This book provides an introduction to Monte Carlo simulations in classical statistical physics and is aimed both at students beginning work in the field and at more experienced researchers who wish to learn more about Monte Carlo methods. The material covered includes methods for both equilibrium and out of equilibrium systems, and common algorithms like the Metropolis and heat-bath algorithms are discussed in detail, as well as more sophisticated ones such as continuous time Monte Carlo, cluster algorithms, multigrid methods, entropic sampling and simulated tempering. Data analysis techniques are also explained starting with straightforward measurement and error-estimation techniques and progressing to topics such as the single and multiple histogram methods and finite size scaling. The last few chapters of the book are devoted to implementation issues, including discussions of such topics as lattice representations, efficient implementation of data structures, multispin coding, parallelization of Monte Carlo algorithms, and random number generation. At the end of the book the authors give a number of example programs demonstrating the applications of these techniques to a variety of well-known models.}},

Equilibration is ensured by using a cluster algorithm including Monte Carlo moves consisting of flipping fundamental excitations. We study the thermodynamic behavior using the Binder cumulant, the spin-glass susceptibility, the distribution of overlaps, the overlap with the ground state, and the specific heat. We confirm that Tc=0. All results are compatible with an algebraic divergence of the correlation length with an exponent ν. We find −1∕ν=−0.295(40), which is compatible with the value for the domain-wall and droplet exponent θ≈−0.29 found previously in ground-state studies. Hence the thermodynamic behavior of this model seems to be governed by one single exponent.},

In uniform fields of various strength, the {Edwards-Anderson} susceptibility χ {EA} Q is calculated at T =0.9 J which is lower than the transition temperature in the zero-field case. It is found that χ {EA} decreases monotonically when the field strength is increased and that the data do not suggest a phase transition in a finite field. The best parameters for the scaling function of the form {χEA}({H)≃lψχ\~{}EA}(({H−Hc})l−ϕ) are estimated to be H c =0.00(10) J , ψ=2.16(22) and φ=-1.13(6).

@article{DasGupta2001Interval,
    abstract = {We revisit the problem of interval estimation of a binomial proportion. The erratic behavior of the coverage probability of the standard Wald confidence interval has previously been remarked on in the literature (Blyth and Still, Agresti and Coull, Santner and others). We begin by showing that the chaotic coverage properties of the Wald interval are far more persistent than is appreciated. Furthermore, common textbook prescriptions regarding its safety are misleading and defective in several respects and cannot be trusted.

This leads us to consideration of alternative intervals. A number of natural alternatives are presented, each with its motivation and context. Each interval is examined for its coverage probability and its length. Based on this analysis, we recommend the Wilson interval or the equal-tailed Jeffreys prior interval for small n and the interval suggested in Agresti and Coull for larger n. We also provide an additional frequentist justification for use of the Jeffreys interval.},

Wilson's suggestion of inverting the related score test with null rather than estimated standard error yields coverage probabilities close to nominal confidence levels, even for very small sample sizes. The 95\% score interval has similar behavior as the adjusted Wald interval obtained after adding two "successes" and two "failures" to the sample.

@article{Cameron2011Estimation,
    abstract = {I present a critical review of techniques for estimating confidence intervals on binomial population proportions inferred from success counts in small to intermediate samples. Population proportions arise frequently as quantities of interest in astronomical research; for instance, in studies aiming to constrain the bar fraction, active galactic nucleus fraction, supermassive black hole fraction, merger fraction, or red sequence fraction from counts of galaxies exhibiting distinct morphological features or stellar populations. However, two of the most widely-used techniques for estimating binomial confidence intervals — the 'normal approximation' and the Clopper \& Pearson approach — are liable to misrepresent the degree of statistical uncertainty present under sampling conditions routinely encountered in astronomical surveys, leading to an ineffective use of the experimental data (and, worse, an inefficient use of the resources expended in obtaining that data). Hence, I provide here an overview of the fundamentals of binomial statistics with two principal aims: (I) to reveal the ease with which (Bayesian) binomial confidence intervals with more satisfactory behaviour may be estimated from the quantiles of the beta distribution using modern mathematical software packages (e.g. r, matlab, mathematica, idl, python); and (ii) to demonstrate convincingly the major flaws of both the 'normal approximation' and the Clopper \& Pearson approach for error estimation.},
